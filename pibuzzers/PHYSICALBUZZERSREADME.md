We may offer assembly of the physical buzzers in the future, that information will be added here if avaliable. In the mean time you can follow the instructions below!
#### What You Need:
To build the physical buzzers you will need the following items (Amazon Links Included):
- Easyget 2 Player Zero Delay Generic Game Controller USB ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FZ6QVWO))
- HAPP Type Arcade Buttons ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M0XPWGG))
- 22 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Wire ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SLBD1FY))
- Heat Shrink Tubing ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WWWPR2X))
- Handheld Hot Air Tool (Optional) (You can use other heat source for shrinking heat shrink) ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VFY8THD))
- Wire Cutters (If you dont already have) ([Amazon Link - Any Other Choice Works Of Course](https://www.amazon.com/IGAN-P6-Precision-Clippers-Spring-loaded-Handmade/dp/B087P191LP))
- Wire Strippers ([Amazon Link - Any Other Choice Works Of Course](https://www.amazon.com/VISE-GRIP-Stripping-Cutter-8-Inch-2078309/dp/B000JNNWQ2))
- 3D Printer: A 3D Printer is used to print the cases/bodys for the physical buzzers. If you dont have one feel free to contact us and we can point you in the right direction for getting the cases/bodys printed for you.
- 3D Printed cases/bodys for the buzzers. (**ADD LINK TO STL FILES HERE**)
    - Each case/body is comprised of the handheld case/body part and a lid that holds the arcade button into the main case/body part.
- Optional Parts:
    - USB Extension Cable (For Getting The Game Controller Closer To The Contestants) (If you dont already have) (We have tested an extension cable up to 6 feet, we will most likely test a 20 foot extender soon and make an edit here) ([Amazon Link - Any Other Choice Works Of Course](https://www.amazon.com/Extension-Material-ITANDA-Playstation-Keyboard/dp/B08FJ88BP2))

#### Preparing The Materials To Build A Buzzer:
For one well made buzzer you will need:
- 1 HAPP Type Arcade Button
- 1 piece of 22 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Wire cut to length with both ends stripped (we have tested up to 14 feet, but theoretically it could be longer, we just have not tested it yet. Currently our version is using 7 foot wires for each buzzer)
- 1 wire harness cut in half with both ends stripped
- 4 small pieces of heat shrink tubing and 2 bigger pieces of heat shrink tubing
- 1 3D Printed case/body

#### **Building Your First Buzzer:**

#### Step 1: Prepare All Of The Materials As Mentioned Above
We will need to use all of the materials mentioned above to create 1 buzzer. Below is a picture of all of these materials laid out

**ADD PICTURE(S) OF ALL MATERIALS LAID OUT**

#### Step 2: Creating The Main Wire

First we need to connect the white connector part of the wire harness to the 22 gage wire. We are doing this first since we will run the other end of the wire through the 3D Printed case/body before attaching the other end of the wire harness. (wire order doesnt necessarily matter, just keep it consistant). First before we connect the wires we want to add two small pieces of wire shrink to the 22 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Wire. Once we have done this we can then connect the blue wire to the black wire and the white wire to the red wire by twisting each corresponding wire together. Then, straighten the wires slide the shrink tubing over the exposed wires and then heat the shrink tubing. We have now completed one end of the wire.

*Note: Dont forget to add your shrink tubing to the wires before twisting them together*

Next we will complete the other end of the wire that will attach to the button. First run the other end of the 22 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Wire through the hole on the bottom of the 3D Printed case/body. Pull a couple feet of this wire through the hole to give us some slack to work with. Then you will complete the same process as above with the connector ends of the wire harness (the metal prong part). Once connected the same way as above the main wire is complete. We can then move on to step 3.

*Note: Dont forget to add your shrink tubing to the wires before twisting them together*

#### Step 3: Bend Down The Connection Pins On The Arcade Button
In order to fit the arcade button in the case/body we need to bend down two of the pins on the arcade button. The other two pins that are on opposite sides of the button are for LEDs which we did not utilize in this project.

Bend down the pins shown in the picture below:

#### Step 4:
Connect the connector ends of the wire harness (the metal prong parts) to the bent pins on the arcade button as seen in the picture below.

#### Step 5: Adding The 3D Printed Case/Body Lid To The Arcade Button
First disconnect the arcade button from the switch controller (the red and black part) by holding the switch controller with one hand and then twisting off the button with your other hand. You should now how the two pieces separated as seen below.

**ADD PICTURE ARCADE BUTTON SEPARATED**

Next remove the plastic bolt type thing from the arcade button and the plastic ring (we will no longer need this plastic ring). See the picture below.

**ADD PICTURE ARCADE BUTTON OTHER PIECES**

Replace the plastic ring with the 3D printed case/body lid and re-screw on plastic bolt type thing to secure the lid tightly. 

**ADD PICTURE OF ARCADE BUTTON WITH NEW RING INSTALLED**

You can now reattach the arcade button to the switch controller by once again holding the switch controller with one hand and then twisting back on the button with your other hand. It should now look like the below picture.

#### Step 6: Insert The Arcade Button Into The 3D Printed Case/Body

You can now pull on the 22 Gauge 2pin 2 Color Wire from the bottom side of the 3D Printed Case/Body to slowly retract the arcade button into the 3D Printed Case/Body. Once pulled in you can insert the button into the 3D Printed Case/Body. It should now look like the below picture.

#### Step 7: Admire Your Newly Created Buzzer
YOU DID IT! You now have one complete buzzer. Before building another one we recommend testing this buzzer by following the instructions in [Connecting The Physical Buzzers To JParty](#connecting-the-physical-buzzers-to-jparty)

Duplicate this process 5 times and you have 5 well made buzzers! (4 buzzers are supported in the code at the moment, this will be changed to 5 soon)
